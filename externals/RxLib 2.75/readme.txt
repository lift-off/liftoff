This is an official conversion of the Rx Library of components for Borland Delphi 6.  You are hearby given permition to distribute the contents of this zip file as long as all copyright notices are kept in there current state.

Rx Library is a set of components and classes for Borland Delphi and C Builder.  Originally developed by Fedor Koshevnikov, Igor Pavluk and Serge Korolev, it has become a widely used and respected addition to the Borland VCL.

Conversion to JVCL
--------------------------

In the "Convert" subdirectory you'll find "JVCL Convert", a global search/replace tool that will help you to convert you RxLib-based projects to JVCL. As you might know already, JVCL incorporates now the RxLib components, but in order to avoid any name conflicts, all of them are renamed to JVCL prefix standard, i.e. "Jv"

After you install JVCL 2.0, and convert your projects, they should work with JVCL. 

Before you start with the conversion, please make sure that your .DFM files are in Text format (open them in Delphi, and save as text).

You can find more information about JVCL on our Website: http://jvcl.sourceforge.net


Compatibility with your older code
-----------------------------------
  - StrUtils has been renamed to rxStrUtils to avoid a naming conflict with borlands new StrUtils module.
  - RxGrids.TInplaceEditStyle type has been converted to the Delphi 6 TEditStyle type.
  - DualList has been renamed to RxDualList
